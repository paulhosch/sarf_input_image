# saRFlood-1 Input Image

This repository contains functionalities for the 1. part of the saRFlood pipeline - Generating the `input_image.tif`.

The `input_image.tif` has bands for input_features, label and more, these will later be used as data for sampling, prediction and validation.

## Input Image Bands

Throught the interactive pipeline.py skript the following bands will be computed and added to the image.

### Other Bands

## Output

The localy saved `input_image.tif` has a resolution of `10m` (DEMs original 30m resolution is resampled) and is defined in `ESPG:4326`
Individual rasters (intermediate results) are saved in `input_image\bands\` in there original reasolutionand projection and serve as a "cache".

## Usage

The usage is outlined in the interactive `pipeline.py`

1. Authenticate with Google Earth Engine:

```bash
earthengine authenticate
```

The main interactive pipeline script `pipeline.py` requires minimal user input:

2. Define the case study name
3. Provide AOI shapefile
4. Provide ground truth shapefile (optional if you want the label band for training or validation)
